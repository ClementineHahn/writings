*Errare humanum est* as an [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom)

People make mistakes, that is, sometimes do not act according to their will or intention.

By definition, a mistake is understood after it was made. 

When facing a mistake, [bienveillance](bienveillance-axiom) added to [the past is the past](the-past-is-the-past-axiom) leads to accepting the mistake forgiving the person who made it and act either to prevent repetition of the mistake or to reduce its negative outcomes next time
