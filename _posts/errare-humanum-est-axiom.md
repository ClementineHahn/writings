*Errare humanum est* as an [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom)

People make mistakes, that is, sometimes do not act according to their will or intention.

By definition, a mistake is understood after it was made. 

When facing a mistake, [bienveillance](bienveillance-axiom.md) added to [the past is the past](the-past-is-the-past-axiom.md) leads to accepting the mistake forgiving the person who made it and act either to prevent repetition of the mistake or to reduce its negative outcomes next time


## In case of violation 

Violation of this axiom means expectation of perfection. In case of error, the expectation may leading to violence against the person who made the mistake or the person who had the expectation to themself.

This goes against the goal of least-suffering
