## Addressing suffering

Working towards the [overarching goal of reducing suffering](./overarching-goals).

To address suffering, one must find the various sources of suffering. Non-exhaustive list, unimportant order:

* malnutrition
* diseases
* human-to-human hurt
    * physical pain
    * heart ache
    * psychological abuse
* anything that frustrates a need and lots of desires

This is the first step.

### Short-term: band-aid

The next step when witnessing suffering is to heal it

band-aid

The problem with band-aids is that in many occasions, the source of suffering isn't addressed and will strike again

### Long-term: prevention

This part takes to study the causes of suffering and address them directly instead of only their effects

There exists a temptation to work only on studying and addressing root causes, however, this process can be extremely long. Band-aid are necessary in the meantime
