title: Human interaction axioms
---

Human interactions are necessary and desired. However, they often lead to suffering or wasted time.

Towards the goals of [reducing suffering and saving time](overarching-goals), these axioms are provided as a baseline to human interactions:
- [Bienveillance](bienveillance-axiom.md)
- [Consent](consent-axiom.md)
- [Errare humanum est](errare-humanum-est-axiom.md)
- [Honesty](honesty-axiom.md)
- [Reality outside humans](reality-outside-humans-axiom.md)
- [Thoughts, emotions and actions](thoughts-emotions-actions-axiom.md)

It's ok to stop interacting with anyone who would disagree with or act against one of these axioms
