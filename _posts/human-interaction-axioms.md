title: Human interaction axioms
---

Towards the goals of [saving time and reducing suffering](overarching-goals), these axioms are provided as a baseline to human interaction:
- [Bienveillance](bienveillance-axiom)
- [Consent](consent-axiom)
- [Errare humanum est](errare-humanum-est-axiom)
- [Honesty](honesty-axiom)
- [The past is the past](the-past-is-the-past-axiom)

It's considered ok to stop interacting with anyone who would disagree with or act against one of these axioms
