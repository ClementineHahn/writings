Honesty as an [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom)

Honesty means always telling what is known to be true or acting according to what was communicated

In case of doubt or not knowing, honesty requires to share the doubt or what is not known

[An error](errare-humanum-est-axiom.md) is not a violation of honesty


## In case of violation 

Violation of this axiom means lying or acting against what was communicated. This can lead to feeling of betrayal or acting in a way that is harmful

This goes against the goal of least-suffering
