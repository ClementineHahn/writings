Consent as an [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom)

One cannot do to another what the other has not consented to.
This rules applies to all individuals who are considered equal in that regard

This means that if Alphonse wants Bruno to do something, Alphonse needs to get Bruno consent first.
1. Alphone states the proposal as clearly as possible with all the information that could make Bruno make up their mind about the proposal
2. Bruno expresses clearly consent or rejection of the proposal whenever they want. During the time of the decision, neither consent nor rejection can be infered
3. What is agreed upon happens

Failure to achieve 1 is a violation of [honesty](honesty-axiom.md) and the consent, if expressed, can be revoked without notice

Forcing a decision in 2 because of time limits leads to the consent being invalid

If either Alphonse or Bruno fail to do 3, it is a violation of [honesty](honesty-axiom.md)
