title: Consent axiom

Consent as an [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom)

One cannot force another to do what the other has not consented to

---

This means that if Alphonse wants Bruno to do something, Alphonse needs to get Bruno consent first.
1. Alphone states the proposal as clearly as possible with all the information that could make Bruno make up their mind about the proposal
2. Whenever they want, Bruno expresses clearly consent or rejection of the proposal whenever they want. During the time of the decision, neither consent nor rejection can be supposed
3. What is agreed on happens

Failure to achieve 1 is a violation of [honesty](honesty-axiom.md)

Forcing a decision in 2 because of time limits leads to the consent being invalid

If either Alphonse or Bruno fail to do 3, it is a violation of [honesty](honesty-axiom.md)


## In case of violation 

Violation of this axiom means forcing someone to do something

This person may be hurt by being forced. This goes against the goal of least-suffering
